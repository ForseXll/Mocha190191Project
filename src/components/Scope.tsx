          The applications will address the online presence issue. Social media
          and other advertising parties will be one way to introduce this web

          The application will allow browsing products and maintaining a state
          while no user sign in. Some technical solutions will let us help users
          maintain a state of carts and sessions without accounts. Verification
          usage of third-party software like stripe will allow verification of
          identity.

          There will also be a portal version of the application that will allow
          the owner or admin to access and manage data in the web application.
          This version will require an account because we want security.

        EmberFrost is a small business that is developing games. Not all games
        are software-based; some are physical cards games. Recently a game has
        been gaining local interest and currently trying to expand and grow on a
        larger scale. The business needs a unique platform where owners can sell
        their products without forcing users to create accounts. Some other
        exciting desires are to create a loyal fan base that will subscribe for
        newsletters and exciting insider information. Another feature that is
        wanted is beta testers. This feature is interesting because people will
        sign up to purchase early releases of products and provide user
        feedback. The main objective is to give users freedom on the web
        application and not tie them down with an account.

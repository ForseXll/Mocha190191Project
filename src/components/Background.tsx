        EmberFrost is a small business that develops games. They focus on
        developing cards games and plan on also developing software-based games.
        Recently one of their games has been gaining local interest and
        currently they are trying to expand and grow on a larger scale. The
        business needs a unique platform where they can sell their products
        without forcing users to create accounts. Users will be able to browse
        products and purchase them without having to sign up like in most
        popular e-commerce websites. Some of their other exciting desires are to
        create a loyal fan base that will subscribe for newsletters and exciting
        insider information. Another feature that they want is open beta testers
        for their new games. This feature is interesting because people will
        sign up to purchase early releases of products and provide user
        feedback. The main objective is to give users freedom on the web
        application and not tie them down with an account.

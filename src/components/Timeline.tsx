        <li>
          <p>
            Sprint 04: Set up a primary environment and create an online version
            of the basic app. Connect to the database, and allow the client to
            see the live version on a development server.

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Sprint 05(Goal): Split the application into two portals. For the
            customer site, allow users to browse applications and experience
            basic functionality. Complete subscription page and primary features

            change the feature page and about page.

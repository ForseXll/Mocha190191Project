# EmberFrost Project with Team Mocha.

### This is our current plan for this project. It requires update since we are on sprint 09 and a lot has changed.

- Sprint 00: Form a team, look for client.

- Sprint 01: Meet with client and get all of the general information about the product.

- Sprint 02: Work closely with the client to create diagrams and tables to understand business requirements.

- Sprint 03: Create basic prototypes and finalize the essential features of the applications. Some of the features will not be implemented or designed but will be added later.

- Sprint 04: Set up a primary environment and create an online version of the basic app. Connect to the database, and allow the client to see the live version on a development server.

- Sprint 05(Goal): Split the application into two portals. For the customer site, allow users to browse applications and experience basic functionality. Complete subscription page and primary features of the web application.

- Sprint 06(Goal): Finalize some of the basic front-end UI features, then fully integrate with the database environment. Finalize the UI prototypes of the Admin portal.

- Sprint 07(Goal): Prioritize back-end functionality to allow the owner to manipulate information on the web applications. The goal is for the owner to access the admin portal and add a product, description, and necessary information. We also want the owner to change the feature page and about page.

- Sprint 08(Goal): Keep working on admin portal functionality and adding features that are requested.

- Sprint 09(Goal): Keep working and maybe adding new features.

- Sprint 10(Goal): Completion of the application, with all required components.
